# Complex fractal trainability boundary can arise from trivial non-convexity 

## General information
".jl" and ".py" are mainly for experiments, ".ipynb" is for tests and data analysis, and ".mat" contains raw data. Note exp-i.jl and gpuexp-i.py are doing the same experiment. We move the latter to GPUs.

Here is a one dimensional fractal generated based on loss during training, where the x-axis is learning rate and the y-axis has no meaning.
